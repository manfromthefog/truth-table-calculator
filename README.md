# Truth Table
Truth Tables are fundamental in logic to evalulate equivalence of logical statements. I find the idea of constructing a truth table and evaluating every little component very tedious, hence I created a calculator.

## Functions
You can specify the amount of variables and input complex logical statements.
The DOM auto-updates upon user input.

## Input Formats
1. All logic should be surrounded by brackets.
2. Currently, the only operations supported are AND, OR, NOT, IMP, and IFF. I will add more operations like XOR and NOR in the future.
3. If there's a problem in the input the __Update__ button should become disabled.
4. Please report any bugs to me by raising an issue. This is version 1.0, I don't expect things to be perfect.

## Future Functionality
- You will be able to add more columns.
- You will be able to search for a specific row in the truth table and have an option to compare things side-by-side.
- You will be able to download your truth table and re-upload it (in case you discover a new theorem, be sure mention me please =)
